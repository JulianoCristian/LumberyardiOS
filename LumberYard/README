To implement LumberYard:

Add to you PCH file:
#ifdef __OBJC__
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    #import "LumberYard.h" <-----------------THIS SPECIFICALLY
#endif

//Set logging visibility level
#ifdef DEBUG
static const int ddLogLevel = LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE; //or whatever level you want
#else
static const int ddLogLevel = LOG_LEVEL_INFO; //or whatever level you want
#endif

Now, replace all your NSLogs with a type of DDLog
All logging will try to print to the console, the logging visibility level defined above will determine if it shows up or not. The types are:
DDLogVerbose
DDLogDebug
DDLogInfo
DDLogWarn
DDLogError

Levels of Logging
LOG_LEVEL_ERROR, then you will only see DDLogError statements.
LOG_LEVEL_WARN, then you will only see DDLogError and DDLogWarn statements.
LOG_LEVEL_INFO, you'll see Error, Warn and Info statements.
LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG, you'll see Error, Warn, Info and Debug statements.
LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE, you'll see all DDLog statements.
LOG_LEVEL_OFF, you won't see any DDLog statements.


TODO: 
Develop custom attributes that can be added to the logger as meta data.
default attributes: Appname, AppID, DeviceName, some sort of unique device identifier thats not UUID
